# ResearchFLO
An open access journal that aims to promote research among students in India from a very tender age. We follow the basic concepts of open access but our way of putting this out to people and letting them use it is different from the current scenario.<br>

This platform offers students a higher probability to get their papers published and the best part is that it is open source and free of cost. We also look at removing the language barrier when it comes to learning along with promoting research among students from the very beginning and are making a multilingual research publication portal that gives you a higher paper publishing rate.<br>

We believe that language or money should never come between a student and his/her dream or desire to learn. For this, we currently provide support for various languages like Telugu, Hindi, Tamil, Punjabi and Marathi and are looking at allowing people to download and upload papers for publishing once reviewed by an expert panel for FREE.<br>

This product aims at helping the student community.<br>
