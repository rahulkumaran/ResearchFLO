# ResearchFLO
An open access journal that aims to promote research among students in India from a very tender age. We follow the basic concepts of open access but our way of putting this out to people is different.<br>

This platform offers students a higher probability to get their papers published and the best part is that it is open source and free of cost.We also look at removing the language barrier when it comes to learning along with promoting research among students from the very beginning and are making a multilingual research publication portal that gives you a higher paper publishing rate.<br>
We currently provide support for various languages like Telugu, Hindi, Tamil, Punjabi and Marathi.<br>

This product aims at helping the student community.<br>
